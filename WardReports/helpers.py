Dear Ward {ward_number},

Today is week {weeks_of_census()} of the Census Response Period. As of today, {int(counted_per_ward(ward_agg, ward_number)['Num_Counted']):,} households in your ward have responded to the 2020 Census. This means there are about **{int(counted_per_ward(ward_agg, ward_number)['Num_Uncounted']):,} households left to count**!

Here are some additional facts about how Chicago wards are doing:

* **Best performer** *: Ward {best_performer} is at {ward_agg['Percent Counted'].max()}% of its target 2020 response rate (Your Ward is at {counted_per_ward(ward_agg, ward_number)['Perc_Counted']}%)

* **Most improved**: Ward {most_improved_ward} had a {max_weekly_rate_change_percent}% increase in the number of households responding compared to last week (Your Ward is at {round(ward_weekly_rate_df[ward_weekly_rate_df['WARD']==ward_number]['Rate_Change'].values[0]*100,2)}%).

Overall, {total_reported_perc}% of all Chicagoans have responded to the Census. There are about {int(households_left):,} households left to count in Chicago.

Remember, for every additional person counted in Chicago, we stand to gain approximately $1,400 that could be used towards parks, schools, and infrastructure!

*Target rates are based on each wardâ€™s 2010 Census response rate and a city overall target of 75% response.
